# Complete Specification Skylight Shell/Programming Language

## Intro
Skylight will be a Unix shell and high level general purpose programming language. Unlike most shells and scripting languages, Skylight will be statically typed and have an option to compile for increased performance. The syntax takes inspiration from Swift and the C language family, while still being compatible with BASH style commands.

## Motivation
The goal of Skylight is to be a single language for all levels of software. Instead of having a different syntax for your shell, scripts, build system and primary code base, they can all be Skylight. Skylight will reduce context switching and be a pleasure to work in at all stages of development. The improvement over existing languages will be particularly noticeable in the field of shell scripting, where there is huge room for improvement.

## Purpose of This Document
This document is to eventually be the complete specification of the language. My last language, [Pinecone](https://pinecone-lang.herokuapp.com/index.html) was designed and implemented in parallel with little external feedback. While this suited the goals of that project in some ways, it was not ideal in others. This time around I will design the language, get feedback and iterate on the design several times before I even begin implementation. This document on GitHub is the single source of truth of the current specification of the language. If you want to give feedback, please do not open a GitHub issue but instead join the discussion on [this reddit thread that I forgot to link so it won't work](https://http.cat/404).
