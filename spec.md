# Complete Specification Skylight Shell/Programming Language

## Intro
Skylight will be a Unix shell and high level general purpose programming language. Unlike most shells and scripting languages, Skylight will statically typed and have an option to compile for increased performance. The syntax takes inspiration from Swift and the C language family, while still being compatible with BASH style commands.

## Motivation
The goal of Skylight is to be a single language for all levels of software. Instead of having a different syntax for your shell, scripts, build system and primary code base, they can all be Skylight. Skylight will reduce context switching and be a pleasure to work in at all levels of development. The improvement over existing languages will be particularly noticeable in the field of shell scripting, where there is huge room for improvement.
